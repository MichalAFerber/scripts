## ðŸ“¦ External Script Projects

These are maintained in dedicated repositories but are part of my broader toolset:

- [`welcome-message`](https://github.com/MichalAFerber/welcome-message)  
  âœ¨ Auto-installs a custom login banner with system info, Fastfetch, and multi-language support.

- [`IMDbMovieFileFixer`](https://github.com/MichalAFerber/IMDbMovieFileFixer)  
  ðŸŽ¬ Renames movie files using IMDb metadataâ€”ideal for tidying up Plex and Jellyfin libraries.

## Usage

- Most scripts are standalone and require Python 3 or bash.
- Navigate into the script's folder or run scripts with full path.
- Review script comments at the top for any specific usage instructions or configuration needed.
- Kavita scripts assume specific folder structures and may require customizing base directories.
- Docker scripts require Docker and Docker Compose installed and configured.
- Rsync script requires `rsync` installed on the system.
