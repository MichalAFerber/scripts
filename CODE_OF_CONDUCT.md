## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.
